# Python-Projects
Project Description: The objective of this project was to predict house prices (dependent variable) using various independent variables from the Melbourne Housing Dataset obtained from Kaggle. Deploying machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression and random forest models, successful predictive models have been developed with high accuracy.
Responsibilities:

•	Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and assess the need for machine learning.

•	Performed extensive data manipulation including statistical analysis, data selection, filtering, sorting, grouping, and cleaning.

•	Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization to comprehend data characteristics and distributions, identifying patterns and correlations.

•	Developed predictive models, including linear regression and random forest, achieving 65% and 80% accuracy respectively.
